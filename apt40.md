## ðŸ”¹ 1.1 Rapid exploitation of public vulnerabilities  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 can exploit newly published vulnerabilities within hours or days.  
**Negation:**  
- Apply patches or virtual WAF rules within hours.  
- **Effect:** Blocks the attackerâ€™s initial access method.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.2 Targeting SOHO and legacy devices  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 uses compromised SOHO or end-of-life network devices for C2 or pivot points.  
**Negation:**  
- Retire or isolate legacy devices, disable unused interfaces, segment networks strictly.  
- **Effect:** Removes easy pivot targets from the network.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.3 Zeroâ€‘day exploitation of devices  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 leverages zero-day or unpatched vulnerabilities in network devices.  
**Negation:**  
- Use IDS/IPS with behavioral detection and enforce exploit mitigations (e.g., DEP/ASLR, CFG).  
- **Effect:** Detects and blocks exploits before payload delivery.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.1 Phishing that delivers ScanBox implant  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 delivers ScanBox via phishing campaigns.  
**Negation:**  
- Enforce strict email filtering, sandbox attachments, block macros.  
- **Effect:** Prevents implant landing, halting persistence.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.2 Early web-shell deployment  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 deploys web shells shortly after initial compromise.  
**Negation:**  
- Harden web servers, enable file-integrity monitoring with YARA rules.  
- **Effect:** Detects and removes web shells before credential access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.3 Payload hosting via cloud or proxy infrastructure  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 hosts payloads on cloud services or via multiplexed proxy infrastructure.  
**Negation:**  
- Enforce egress filtering, inspect TLS, and monitor outbound anomalies.  
- **Effect:** Blocks or exposes remote payload delivery and C2.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3.1 Credential harvesting  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 steals privileged credentials from compromised hosts.  
**Negation:**  
- Use endpoint protection to detect credential dumps, enforce MFA, rotate credentials.  
- **Effect:** Prevents credential misuse and unauthorized system access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3.2 Lateral movement  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 moves laterally using stolen credentials.  
**Negation:**  
- Implement micro-segmentation, restrict RDP/SMB access, deploy UEBA.  
- **Effect:** Prevents lateral advancement across network segments.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3.3 Reconnaissance for pivoting  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 performs internal reconnaissance to map targets.  
**Negation:**  
- Monitor for internal scans and restrict enumeration protocols.  
- **Effect:** Triggers alerts before pivots occur.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4.1 Multiple access vectors  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 maintains redundancy via SOHO devices or custom apps.  
**Negation:**  
- Secure all exposed surfaces with hardening, testing, and segmentation.  
- **Effect:** Closes redundant paths and forces attackers to dead ends.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4.2 Infrastructure via compromised devices  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 uses compromised devices as C2 relays.  
**Negation:**  
- Keep device inventories, run threat hunts, isolate anomalies quickly.  
- **Effect:** Disrupts compromised infrastructure before itâ€™s weaponized.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4.3 ORB/proxy C2 networks  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 uses proxy networks to hide command-and-control traffic.  
**Negation:**  
- Correlate DNS logs and TLS fingerprints across hosts.  
- **Effect:** Detects covert C2 channels and allows network-wide blocking.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5.1 Session-hijack token collection  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 exfiltrates session tokens to hijack legitimate sessions.  
**Negation:**  
- Tie sessions to MFA, IP checks; revoke if anomalies appear.  
- **Effect:** Invalidates stolen tokens and prevents unauthorized access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5.2 Reuse of credentials after remediation  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 uses stolen credentials even after initial patches.  
**Negation:**  
- Rotate all credentials and tokens post-remediation.  
- **Effect:** Neutralizes attacker persistence through stolen credentials.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6.1 Early reconnaissance implants  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 deploys recon implants (e.g., ScanBox) early.  
**Negation:**  
- Use EDR detection for reconnaissance frameworks.  
- **Effect:** Blocks recon activity before lateral movement or C2.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6.2 C2 via cloud or proxy networks  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 uses cloud or proxy services for command-and-control.  
**Negation:**  
- Restrict outbound destinations, inspect TLS fingerprints.  
- **Effect:** Disables communication pipelines instantly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6.3 Exfiltration via C2 channels  
**Sub-premise:** APT40 exfiltrates stolen data over active C2 tunnels.  
**Negation:**  
- Deploy Data Loss Prevention to flag suspicious uploads.  
- **Effect:** Interrupts exfil before data leaves the environment.
